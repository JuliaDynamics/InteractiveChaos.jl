This page describes functions that can be used in conjunction with [Agents.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/dev/) to animate and interact with agent based models.

The animation at the start of this page was done by running the `examples/daisyworld.jl` file, and see also an example application in [Agents.jl docs](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/dev/examples/schelling/).
