`InteractiveChaos` is a package that provides applications for interactively exploring dynamical systems. It _extends_ various packages of [JuliaDynamics](https://juliadynamics.github.io/JuliaDynamics/).

To install it do `]add InteractiveChaos Makie`. `Makie` is necessary for providing a plotting backend, since `InteractiveChaos` does not install one by default.

#TODO: Add bullet points of what this is
#TODO: say it works for any class of systems
#TODO: say that it uses requires.

The functionality of `InteractiveChaos` is contained within individual functions, all of which launch a dedicated interactive application. Here is their list:

* [`interactive_orbitdiagram`](@ref)
* [`interactive_poincaresos`](@ref)
* [`trajectory_highlighter`](@ref)
* [`interactive_billiard`](@ref)

!!! info "Example animations"
    Besides the documentation strings, each interactive function is accompanied with an animation (`.gif` or `.mp4` file) displayed after the docstring!
    All of these animations are generated by simply running examples from the  `examples` folder.
    Some of these applications are potentially used in the [JuliaDynamics YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR4GZ9B3uhyLbYRdZEr7oKg)
